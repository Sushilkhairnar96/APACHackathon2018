Problem: Business needs user interfaces/dashboards to understand data and take action. Producing bespoke UIs is massively time consuming

Challenge: You will be provided with three data sets from different lines of business. Produce a tool that can produce meaningful dashboards for the three datasets and any other data sets.

Judging: Teams will be judged on how impactful their tool is for each business line and how well their tool can support other datasets.

Create a Smart Client report analytics framework to be used as a go-to place to review client revenue and other metrics.

The proposed system should present a ready-to-print report on a clientâ€™s key metrics, such as:

- Revenue by markets
- Return on assets
- Balance history
- Efficiencies
- Profitability.

The first six tabs of the attached **prime_client_metrics.xlsx** contain data. The last three tabs contain expected views.

Use a combination of AI to help Front Office Management understand their client base and provide insights on opportunities and connections.

Provide a map where managers can see clients by:
- Geography

Questions that we want the visualization to be able to answer:

- Who covers a client for a certain market and who is the backup?
- How does the coverage look for a certain desk?
- How does the coverage look for a certain client?
- How does the coverage look for a certain market?
- Which client is not covered in a certain market?
