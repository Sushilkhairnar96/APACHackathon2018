**Problem**

 

Business needs user interarfaces/dashboards to understand this data and take action

 

Producing bespoke UIs is massively time consuming

 

**Challenge**

 

You will be provided with three data sets from different lines of business. Produce a tool that can produce meaningful dashboards for the three datasets.

 

**Judging**

 

Teams will be judged on impactful their tool is for each business line and well their tool can support other datasets.

Create a Smart Client report analytics framework to be used as a go-to place to review client revenue and other metrics.

 

The proposed system should present a ready-to-print report on a clientâ€™s key metrics, such as:

- Revenue by markets

- Return on assets

- Balance history

- Efficiencies

- Profitability.

 

The first six tabs of the attached **prime_client_metrics.xlsx** contain data. The last three tabs contain expected views.
